* VERY IMPORTANT NOTE [I'M USING THE LATEST DART AND LATEST FLUTTER VERSION, PLEASE USE THE BEST PRACTICE FOR BETTER CODE]

* VERY IMPORTANT NOTE [IN EXAMPLES, PLEASE FOLLOW THE BEST PRACTICE FOR BETTER CODE AT "https://dart.dev/effective-dart", PLEASE FORMAT THE EXAMPLES AS A FORMATTED DART CODE]

add "Why design patterns?"
- Avoid reinventing the wheel
- Improve code readability, maintainability, scalability, testability, reusability, flexibility, extensibility, performance, security, reliability, efficiency, simplicity and 
- Communication between developers, using a common vocabulary
- Leverage the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


next time
- DO NOT ADD \n in the first char in the print or log like that `print('\n...)`, instead make it like that `print('...')`
- only use DART SHORTHANDS when available, dot shorthands not working with `Duration`s.
- Use raw multi-line string (r```...```) instead of normal one (```...```) so you don't have to add slashes for special chars. also note! it has only one `r`, so instead of `r'''...r''' just use `r'''...'''`.
- make sure to include the needed imports
